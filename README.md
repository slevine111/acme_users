heroku link is https://my-user-paging-site.herokuapp.com/#/. One thing to note is that my repo has two branches, this branch (master) and code_with_table_reloading. This branch has only route, "/users", in App.js for generating the Users page for both when the search field is and is not
empty and instead uses some complicated regex msnipulation to parse if there is a search term or not and what hence to do. The code_with_table_reloading branch has different routes in App.js correpsonding to the two different back-end routes. This way, with the different routes, is surely the proper way to go and how I started. However, with this way, for me, the UsersPage remounts when I switch routes, i.e. go from no
search term to a search term, which I definitely do NOT want b/c it causes the table to disappear and reappear with the highlighted text instead of highlighting in place. I am super confused why this is happening. I was able to suss out Prof's actual code in the webpackified version and he is using two routes too and the highlighting is occuring in place. With my sub-optimal, RegEx-dependent code in master, the text is being highlgihted in
place, hence why I am using it.

UPDATE: FIGURED IT OUT. NEEDED A SWITCH TO WRAP AROUND TWO USERS ROUTE. WHEN ABSTRACTION IS VERY ANNOYING (Prof's code also has the Switch)
